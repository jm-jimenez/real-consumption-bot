# real-consumption-bot
A telegram bot which tracks your vehicle real mileage. You can find, test, and use the production version by adding the Telegram Bot @RealConsumptionBot.

This work uses the pengard's [java-telegram-bot-api](https://github.com/pengrad/java-telegram-bot-api) to perform the communication with the bot, as well as [KeystoneJS](http://keystonejs.com/) to manage the requests and to store the data. In the future, this framework will be used to provide a browser access to insert and review refuels.
